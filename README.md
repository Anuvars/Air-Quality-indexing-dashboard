### 🌫️ **Air Quality Indexing Dashboard (MERN Stack)**

**Description:**
The *Air Quality Indexing Dashboard* is a modern full-stack web application built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** that monitors and visualizes air quality data in real-time. It provides a clean and interactive interface for users to view, analyze, and compare air quality levels across various locations.

The backend API, developed in **Node.js and Express**, handles CRUD operations for air quality data, while **MongoDB** stores sensor readings such as PM2.5, PM10, CO₂, and temperature values. **React.js** powers the dynamic frontend with responsive charts and dashboards for intuitive data visualization.

Data is fetched and tested through **Postman API** endpoints, ensuring secure and efficient communication between client and server. The dashboard includes real-time updates, filtering by city or region, and AQI categorization based on pollution levels (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, etc.).
